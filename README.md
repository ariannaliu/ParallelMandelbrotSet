# ParallelMandelbrotSet
Using MPI and Pthread to implement Parallel version of Mandelbrot Set Computation
PLEASE follow the instructions in the PDF report and replace the main.cpp in the imgui folder to use each parallel version.

Description :
Download the sequential Mandelbrot program from

     http://www.cs.nthu.edu.tw/~ychung/homework/para_programming/seq_mandelbrot_c.htm
and compile and run the program based on your machine setting of Xlib (This program uses Xlib calls for the graphics.  It is necessary to link the appropriate libraries.)  Write the parallel version of the program using MPI and Pthread.
